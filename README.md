# Shopee Spend Calculator
Note: This only works with the Singapore version of Shopee.
A tool to help you figure out how much you're spending on Shopee (since Shopee doesn't have a simple way to show you).

## Instructions
1. Copy code from the file `shopee_calculator_sg.js`
2. Go to [Shopee's website](https://shopee.sg) and log in into your Shopee account
3. While staying on the Shopee website, open your browser's Console:
  * Safari: `⌘ + ⌥ + C`
  * Chrome (Mac): `⌘ + ⌥ + J`
  * Chrome (Windows): `CTRL + ⇧ + J`
5. Paste the code into the Console input and press `Enter`/`return`
6. The code will run & should then generate a CSV file that will autodownload
7. You can open that CSV file in Excel to see all your expenses made on Shopee (sorted by date)
